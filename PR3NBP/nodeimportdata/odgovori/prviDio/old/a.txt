Contacted another seller who told me that didn't matter but in my case it did, so check your info on the back of your original against the info in the description to make sure if it will work, if your not sure you can aways email them, I received an answer in 5 min and it was Sunday! Would I purchase this remote again? I just order another one now that I know it works!Update to above review:After programming the 1st remote we realized the door keypad on our 2004 Ford F250 Diesel Truck no longer worked!I contacted seller, while the investigated I looked in the manual for the truck; there was a section on programming a new remote. The instructions were different from the ones online or that I had been told by dealership...the difference: It said after truck goes into program mode you have to hold down the 7-8 and 9-0 (at the same time) on the door keypad then push any key on the remote,now everything works again! So my advise is to check your manual for instructions for your vehicle, Nowhere did it say the keypad would would be deprogrammed and have to be reset in any of the instructions I found for my vehicle!!"

Years ago I used a natural deerskin chamois and found it gross to touch especially when it was wet; it smelled funky and felt really slimy. Plus the thought of wringing water from a deer's skin was creepy.I've used the Absorber for about 6 car washes and it has held up to almost as many times in the washing machine. It soaks up (and holds) a lot of water. I only have to wring it out about four times to dry the entire car. Another bonus is that you can store it damp in the container and don't have to leave a stiff and scratchy deer pelt hanging in the garage. I would definitely recommend the Absorber."

I purchased one at a Pep Boys last year, and one at Wal-Mart a few weeks ago.Product: 5 Stars.It is a synthetic chamois that has a vaguely rubbery feel.It can be wrung out after getting wet and used to sop up more moisture.Uses Below...Price: 4 Stars.If there is a harbor freight near you, they also sell a Chinese knock-off version of this for about $5, less than half the price of both brands for almost the same thing. The material is a little softer since it is not as dense, and you can see the fibers woven through it that are used for structural integrity. The 'real' one may not have these, i haven't held mine up to the light to check. Most people will be just fine with the HF one.This is:Perfect pool-side towel, car chamois, camp towel, motorcycle, etc.Good for cleaning up spills and wetness. Hard floors: soak and wring. Carpet: Soak the spill in water (Yes, make it WORSE), THEN put towel over and apply pressure to soak up.Mores uses I'm sure, but this are the ones I find I use the most.Every home should have one of these.Stories:Pool - My 5 cousins and I use a single one of these when drying off after using the pool, but any number of people can as long as they're not germophobes. Dry, wring, repeat.Car - Don't want water spots? Wash and rinse car as per usual, use this to dry it off. If you're paranoid of it picking up particulate like a sponge can, machine wash it first.Motorcycle - Use it to dry after washing. Dry seat after a rain so you don't soak up wetness with your pants. Friend uses a thick foam seat pad, after riding in the rain and then washing it, was soaked through. He didn't want to put his rain gear on so we put the towel on top of it and stepped on it to pull the moisture out, it was nearly dry after a few wrings."

For this purpose there is no equal. Just stick it in a pocket or hanging out of the waist band and when your done with a ride ring it out and dry yourself off!

I'll soak it with a little bleach.\" It bleached, but the spots did not come out.I'm typing this with the smell of bleach still fresh and I'm thinking, \"Really? Am I going to rub a moldy anything over the top of my car?\" And I'm pretty sure I've put too much effort into the maintenance of this product. Maybe I should complete a video review..."

One day I was at T@rget and saw this in the automotive section read the back and said \"hey why not, worth a shot\". Well that shot paid off big time! This thing is amazing at what it does and leaves my car streak-free and shining beautifully when done. What works best for me is that it HAS to be somewhat wet before starting to use it; not saturated or sopping wet but a good damp works. The amount of water the absorber retains really is a feat in itself. I recommend this highly and trust it fully to always get the job done."

Now back to my blurb.-----After watching the silly \"ShamWow\" infomercial once or twice I developed the desire to purchase a chamois like product. My first attempt was with the previously mentioned \"--Wow\" which really left a lot to be desired. Quite frankly, it was crap! Once I was burned by the hype, I figured I'd try a different approach, I'd do some research. (novel idea) Upon hitting up Amazon I found that this one always got high reviews and people seemed to be saying, \"yep, it's the one!\". So I bought it and I haven't been disappointed. It works like a chamois, period. Get it a little damp, use it to suck up liquids, squeeze, repeat. It gets the job done.If you want something that acts exactly like a REAL lambskin chamois that's not a REAL lambskin chamois, this is the product for you. Just buy it and be happy."

                "text" : "My wife was extremely pleased to find that this item is Made in Japan--both because she takes it as a sign of quality and because she's Made in Japan herself.We're also familiar with this kind of product in Japan, where it's called a \"gum towel.\"I bought two actually, one for her and one for me to use on my bicycles--thinking it would be something like a super absorbant chamois rather than a gum towel. It's certainly super absorbant, but doesn't have the chamois quality I would need to, say, polish my bike frames. That is to say it's more sticky than soft, more like a piece of foam rubber or neoprene than a cloth.So if I just hosed down the bike while cleaning and wanted to get on with the next steps of polishing and relubing, this towel is a great way to dry the bike when it's neither hot nor dry enough of a day for the bike to dry out on it's own in a fair amount of time.It really draws the water out too, from every knook and cranny, so no need to use DW-40 before lubing my nice clean parts.My wife uses ours for everything from picking up spills to quickly drying wet clothing that can't go in the dryer. If you wash a sweater for example, it's best to roll it up in the Absorber before laying it out to dry, as this will cut your drying time to at least half and make it less of a hazard that the sweater will get out of shape.We use my far more grungy one as you might use a wet vac. It actually does a better job than a wet vac though.Add that I've used several gum towels in Japan, mostly for swimming, and this is by far the thickest one I've used--therefore more absorbant. And at 27\" x 17\" it's big enough to be used as a bath towel without having to ring it out over and over again.BOTTOM LINE:I recommend this particular make and model over others simply based on the large size and the thickness of the towel.Don't expect to use this to polish or dust, as the texture of the towel is far too sticky for that.I initially searched for the Sham-Wow on Amazon because I had seen it on TV, and still would like to try it out because it seems like it might be more chamois like--where you could wipe and polish with it.Overall, we're thrilled with the quality, size, and how well this item works. Absolutely 5 stars."

Practical though, because you don't have to waste a bunch of regular towels - just squeeze it and reuse. Has the texture of a thin piece of leather. Doesn't scratch the paint, unless you get some dirt caught in it. And if you clean the car thoroughly first, that won't happen. It does need to be put away damp though. If you don't it'll dry out very stiff. It claims not to grow mold/mildew, even when stored wet, though I haven't tested that out long-term. Short-term (two weeks) it seemed fine.Disadvantages:* It tends to not absorb all the water, even when you start. It'll leave small thin streaks on the car which you have to pass over again.* There's a relatively high amount of friction in the material, so it's hard to move it across the car. After a few minutes of use it improves a bit.* Dirt stains refuse to come out easily - wouldn't recommend it for washing the car.If I had opportunity to buy again, at the right price, I would.

Great for drying cars, motorcycles, whatever. If you wanted to dry your own body with it, you could, but then you should wash it regularly. It does need to be moist to work, so just wring it out and store it. Once moist, it stays moist almost indefinitely if kept in it's container, even though there is a drain hole. The only caveat is that some kinda black mold does grow on it, or in it."

It squeezes out easy and stores quite well in the container it comes in. I have used it a number of times and am generally happy with it.I should mention it is does not perfectly get every last bit of water.

The finish on my car is pristine and my 7 year old Chevrolet may be getting old, but the paint/finish sparkles just as is it did on the day I picked it up from the lot. I even use the cloth for a few days after I washed my car to get rid of any morning dew to prevent water streaks.One good suggestion is that after you're done drying, spray THE ABSORBER with the hose and ring it out to ensure all heavy debris is removed from the product. I always roll it up neatly in the form that I purchased it in and always store it in the container. It will feel slightly moist every time you take it out, but that lets me know that it's still working.From the looks of these reviews people suggest putting it in the washer/dishwasher to clean but honestly I have yet to try this out in the last 10 years (oops?) but it still seems perfectly clean.Buy at least one of these or 2+ if you want to keep it in handy places."

For this purpose there is no equal. Just stick it in a pocket or hanging out of the waist band and when your done with a ride ring it out and dry yourself off! Wash it once home with a small amount of bleach (do not dry it) and put it back in its container to keep it moist.Overall this is simply the best chamois you can get and there's a million uses for it!"

I have always just rolled it up after I use it and keep it in the provided tube. Even when it goes several weeks between uses, the Absorber is still slightly damp and ready to use. This is extremely important, as anyone that has ever tried to use a dried out chamois knows... I had thought that keeping it in the tube would maybe make it smell or get mildew or something like that. Not the case at all.I sometimes use the absorber for greasy cleaning, on those occassions, I will wash it in the washer. It comes out perfectly fine. I don't put it in the dryer as there is no need.For the use on the boat, I highly recommend this product. After washing boat, a quick wipe with the absorber keeps all the water sports off of the chrome and aluminum. It also keeps water spots off any waxed areas. Sometimes, we go fishing very early in the morning and the seats are wet with condensation - the Absorber is perfect for a quick solution.I have also rolled ice cubes up into the absorber and put it around my neck on a few extremely hot days of fishing the Gulf. It's not perfect for that, but still helped a lot!I can't imagine anyone not giving this product a perfect rating."

I used this product right after purchase (be sure to soak it in warm water as instructed before use for a few minutes and wring it out good) and it worked much better than any chamois that I have ever used. Super absorbent and no streaks! Just wring it out as it absorbs and you will have your car sqeeky clean and streak free in no time. If it is dirty afterwards ,,,, again wash it out in warm water ,,, wring it out and store it in the container while damp. Will last a long time. Machine washable if needed .....and at this great price maybe you want a couple of them. I'm gonna buy a second one because I am SO impressed. Buy one now,,,,, you will NOT regret it. My new black Lexus looks like it did when it was delivered to me...sparkling."

The Absorber is PVA, so it needs to stay a little wet because it gets very stiff when dry. Once you get used to it and how it works, it's great. There are a lot of PVA drying towels out there that are cheaper, but believe me, this one is superior in thickness and quality. I bought a cheap, generic one at Wal-Mart and it started tearing apart within a couple days.I use mine to wipe down just about anything and everything you'd use a normal towel for. It won't get something as immediately dry to the touch as a towel since it is slightly damp to start with, but evaporation quickly takes care of the rest. The main advantage over a towel is that it works like both a towel and a sponge, depending on how wet it is. It's nice and cool to the touch so it doubles as a cooling cloth in the summer heat. When it gets too wet, you just wring it out. When it gets a little dirty, soak it in a little soap and water and wring it out or throw it in the washer (just make sure you don't put it in the dryer, it comes out of the washer slightly damp, just like it should be stored). Every few washes, I recommend using some bleach in the wash or soaking it with some bleach to help keep it like new."

It's also useful if you're working on a plumbing project and need something to quickly absorb the water around the working area. Some people even keep this in the shower to give it a quick wipe-down after use. Just remember to store it in the original container so it doesn't dry out completely and become brittle; as this repeated cycle will eventually shorten it's lifespan. This is a WONDERFUL product.

This synthetic chamois was fantastic straight out of the tube the first time I used it. Natural chamois would require at least a half-dozen uses before it gained maximum absorbency and lost all its \"flakes\". This product was immediately effective, did not leave any residue on the car and is very absorbent. The size is excellent and easy to manage. Because I live in a very humid environment, I choose not to store the damp chamois back in the tube and although it gets stiff, it softens up as soon as it gets wet and is immediately ready for use.

                "text" : "Works great for drying the car quickly and easily when its not hot enough out to do it quickly, and you don't wanna have to polish out all the water spots afterwords (Black car). This thing absorbs so much water you won't believe it till you use it, and it just takes a beating and keeps on going. When I first used it I was afraid I was gonna rip it by twisting the water out too hard, nope, just keep wringing it out until its dry and continue on.A little secret to using it, at least I've found it to work better this way. When drying the car, lay the Absorber out flat (unfold it across the surface) and then grasp it at one end at each corner and drag it slowly across the car allowing it to absorb all the water it comes into contact with. This works especially well on horizontal surfaces, but still good enough on the vertical ones as well. This practice also helps to prevent scratching of the surface when small particles get trapped between the chamois and the paint surface and then your hand comes and pushes it right into the paint.Little warning, when it comes, don't smell it. Mine reeeeekkkkkeeedddd! But I just rinsed it out and the smell went away. Yes it is true that you can put it right back into the tube wet (Well to get it back in the tube, you must, because you can't roll it once it dry), but I like to leave the top off of the tube to allow air in there to dry it out before I close it up and that musty gross smell comes back.Long story short: Get it, you won't be disappointed."

They never dry the dog good enough and they get soaked fast. Once they're soaked, they're pretty worthless, even if you wring them out. So you end up with a pile of wet towels to wash and a dog that is still rather wet.Enter The Absorber. It absorbs a TON of water and when it's soaked through, you wring it out and it's ready for more, not just a little more, a lot more. My dog comes away from a drying with this towel only a bit damp, which is an enormous improvement over every other towel we've tried, where he stays wet for hours and continues to shake himself off periodically. This artificial chamois really cuts down on the drying time."

The packaging on the one I bought says it will dry a car in 2-3 minutes and I guess if you could wipe and wring fast enough it would but 8-10 minutes was OK with me. And it was done. I walked around the car expecting to have to do some finishing up but it was all done. Let the sheep keep their skins. Get an Absorber.I don't know if Amazon will want this in the review but I think the material is very interesting. I went to check out what it is made of, (Polyvinyl Alcohol), and I found the following:\"Polyvinyl alcohol has excellent film forming, emulsifying, and adhesive properties. It is also resistant to oil, grease and solvent. It is odorless and nontoxic. It has high tensile strength and flexibility, as well as high oxygen and aroma barrier properties. However these properties are dependent on humidity, in other words, with higher humidity more water is absorbed. The water, which acts as a plasticiser, will then reduce its tensile strength, but increase its elongation and tear strength. PVA is fully degradable and is a quick dissolver. PVA has a melting point of 230C and 180-190C for the fully hydrolysed and partially hydrolysed grades. It decomposes rapidly above 200C as it can undergo pyrolysis at high temperatures.\" via WikipediaI thought the part about it being fully degradable was cool because I was thinking as I used it that it was kind of indestructible and would last forever.It works as well as I could have expected. It's a good deal for $10. I haven't used a Shamwow so I can't make that comparison."

The pool, the beach or as a sweat rag, this chamois can handle anything. I take mine whenever I travel and use it as a bath towel and I never have to worry about how sanitary towels are.When it gets too dirty, all you have to do is throw it in the washing machine and all the dirt gets cleaned off. Remembering to store it wet and in its' tube goes a long way toward having it ready to use.One more thing, no matter what it says, it can indeed get moldy. No matter what, DO NOT store this in a dark place. First the smell arrives, then the spots and before you know it, you have an absorber that has mildew damage and while it still works, it wont last as long.Overall, this is a great product and I will continue to buy them til they are no longer in production."

I also own a black car, which is why I am so picky. NO SWIRL MARKS TO THIS DAY!POSITIVES:-Great towel, dries in 1-2 swipes completely. No water drops or bubbles left.-Comes with nice storage case, and makes it compact to carry around!-No swirl marks! There is no rigged textiles on this towel, and its very soft. Feels like a piece of leather.-1 Towel for the entire car. Hold water like a beast! Doesn't dry anymore? Wringe it out and continue on! No need to have 2 or 3 towels!NEGATIVES:-I have heard horror stories if you drop this towel on the ground, but that is the same as with any towel. Keep this towel clean and it will last.-Can generate a funky smell over time, but just make sure to rinse out all the water and its fine.-USE THIS TOWEL ON THE BODY ONLY! Please don't use this towel to dry off tires and rims because it will dirty it beyond belief and only reduce the quality of the product.OVERALL:If you are looking for an amazing towel, this is it. Take care of this towel and it will bring you happiness, drop it and step on it you will be sadly disappointed. Take care of this towel like your car, and it will make both of you happy! I promise. (I have used this towel for over 12 washes!)"

This thing holds an astounding amount of water for its size and weight and is excellent at streak free drying of automotive surfaces.

So I can put 1 in each car, keep one for the glass stove, maybe have a couple for stocking stuffers.I would agree that they feel a little flimsy. Maybe it's stronger than it feels, maybe it wont break at all. Everyone seems to say that it feels a little flimsy, but I don't remember seeing any reviews that said they actually broke it, so who knows, maybe it's designed to flex, but not break? In any case, they seem fine, my shipment of 8 came in 4 different colors, red, blue, black, and yellow.We'll see, I'll be glad I have this in my arsenal when the ice comes.Update after use: It's pretty good. If I had to complain it would be that you really have to lean onto the car to get to the middle of your windows. It still worked ok, but if you aren't physically able to reach for some reason this isn't really going to be for you. Works good on the glass stove top as others have mentioned. They are good little gifts if you are looking for a good reason to add more to your cart, aside from making the shipping worthwhile."

                "text" : "I bought the CJ Industries F101 Fantastic Ice Scraper last year, when I felt that my usual plastic scraper + brush combo was ineffective.I've found that this is the best scraper I've used, but I do sometimes switch and use that old plastic scraper/brush. What I do now is leave this scraper in my car door slot, and leave the brush/scraper in the trunk of the car, \"just in case\".The scraper does its job very well. Sometimes, it gets cold enough that during the work day, my car will ice over again before quitting time. My coworkers and I leave at the same time, and I am completely out of the parking lot before most of them have even finished their front windshield. (nevermind door windows and rear windshield) It removes ice better than any plastic scraper I've ever used, and for that, I applaud it.Its one shortcoming is that it's somewhat one-dimensional. You certainly won't be using this to move heavy snow from your car, so you'd better have something else for that job--hence why I keep my brush in the trunk. This isn't made for moving anything--just for scraping. It's also on the small side. I'm 6'1\", and I can reasonably reach across the windshield. However, someone with shorter arms may have trouble extending the scraper to reach the halfway point of the windshield, from each side of the car.Its relatively narrow blade does mean you will also be making a number of passes at your glass to clear it. However, I've found the number of passes I make with a plastic scraper that's doing a poor job of actually clearing ice makes this scraper a better solution, for me.The Fantastic Ice Scraper has not scratched anything on my car. Not even a tiny bit. I remember reading somewhere that scraping too close to sides of the windshield and hitting plastic/rubber has caused some brass bending for some people, so I stick to the main visible area of the windshields/windows--it hasn't failed me yet.Overall I cannot recommend this scraper much more. The four stars are only because it isn't the ONLY thing I need, for clearing my car in the winter. If you already have something to push snow, and you have long enough arms to reach across your windshield, this is a five-star product. But that may not be the case for someone looking for an all-in-one solution, or someone with limited reach."

The thing works infinitely better than any plastic scraper on tightly bonded frost, and even on most ice coatings. But my gosh the handle is flimsy! Also the brass blade itself is thin and bends easily. My kids tried to help me the other day and immediately bent the brass blade in one of my new ones. Maybe the construction is so lightweight as a safety feature to help prevent people from cracking their windshields with a massive brass hammer? Anyway, this thing is the best I ever used when used intelligently, plus I can easily re-sharpen the blade on a belt sander if the edge gets rounded. I just wish it was built tougher."

The scraper doesn't weigh that much and was shipped in one of those small, padded mailers. I wanted to order more than one as I had thought to give them as extra gifts for co-workers, family, and friends, but the seller multiplied the shipping charge by the number of items I was planning to buy. They would have cleaned house in profit on mailing the bloody thing to me.

For the past 20 years we've had to make do with a wide variety of plastic-bladed scrapers, none of which ever seemed to hold a candle to these brass-bladed scrapers in my memory.A couple years ago when I got myself a new car, my dad gave me his last brass-bladed scraper he'd had for nearly 30 years (I hadn't seen it since I was little). He now had a garage and thus rarely needed a scraper and wanted me to have the best-of-the-best since my car lives outdoors. You'd of thought he was passing on a priceless heirloom, he was so serious about me not losing it and precisely because we thought they didn't make them anymore. I've been using my Fantastic Ice Scraper for the past two winters and it works just as well as I remember - it wasn't just hyperbole. And just today I discovered that they DO indeed still make them! And they're about $2 apiece - that's fantastic! I cannot wait to buy a dozen of these to hand out to my family members so they'll stop borrowing mine. ;)Another reviewer mentioned their Fantastic scraper lasted about 3 years. Mine is close to 30 years old and still works better than any scraper I've ever used. Brass is a soft metal so as long as you don't use it to chop at blocks of ice you should be fine.From decades of personal experience it seems to me that in order for a plastic-bladed scraper to scrape with any efficiency the inside of the vehicle has to be pretty warm so that the ice on the windows begins melting enough to create a thin layer of water between the ice and the glass so that the plastic can then \"push\" the ice off the windows. When temperatures are REALLY cold, it takes a LOT of fuel and time to get a car warm enough for a plastic scraper to work. Brass blades, on the other hand, seem to cut right through to get between the ice and the glass and actually scrape the ice off with minimal warming in comparison to plastic blades. And brass, being softer than glass, won't scrape up windows - just gotta be careful of rubber seals around the glass and you're good to go.PROS:* Brass blade more durable and efficient than plastic blades* Don't have to warm up your car as much as when using a plastic bladed scraper* Small form slips easily into most glove compartments or sun visor* Inexpensive* Lasts a long, long timeCONS:* Might scrape up plastic tail lights but then I never have any need to scrape mine* Works so well can rip up seals around glass so gotta be a little carefulIf you spend any amount of time every winter scraping your windows on your vehicle, I cannot recommend this scraper enough. I use mine in conjunction with theHopkins 19520 Super Deluxe 22\" Snowbrushbut only for its thin form-factor brush, not its ineffective scraper."

Cleared off ice that any other tool I have used before could not. Then the last couple weeks I noticed small scratches on my window only visible from the inside. After a few more days it was getting worse and worse and I realized this scraper was puting fine horizontal scratches in my window whenever I put pressure on it to scrape off the ice.Stick with the plastic ones. They may not get all the ice off your windshield but at least they won't scratch it up."

Then one of those fancy scrapper reviews pointed me towards the F101. How cheap plastics scrappers are still sold in big box stores and automotive stores is beyond me. The industry has a profit motive in people buying cheap junk over and over again. This scrapper is as close to effortless as scrapping is ever going to get (as compared to plastic scrappers). This really should be the country standard scrapping tool. I can't believe it but this thing makes me excited to scrape because I know the ice is coming off with one pass.Only way to make this product better would be a more \"solid\" handle (the plastic is kind of \"soft\" and it bends ever so slightly), a longer handle, and a wider blade for fewer passes. But that's really nit picky. Maybe CJ Industries will come out with a Deluxe model someday for $2.99 that will include these features, ha!I used FireHawk Tech as the Seller. They seemed to have the cheapest shipping when ordering multiples because the shipping was less the more you bought. The other businesses increased the shipping cost by multiples for additional scrapers which adds up."

I do somewhat agree with the reviewer that said that the handle was a bit flimsy, but in reality it only flexes a bit and I don't feel that it is a cause for concern. One more thing; the handle on the scraper I received was black and not red like in the picture.

Being used to the plastic ice scrapers with super stiff and large handles, I was a skeptical that this handle would hold up to tough ice scraping conditions. Boy was I wrong! The handle doesn't need to be thick and stiff and super strong because the brass blade scrapes the ice off with very little effort. Dare I say it is EFFORTLESS. The small handle and thin profile ensures that it easily fits in the door pocket of both our cars and can be left there year round. My wife doesn't even ask me to scrape her window anymore.

Let me address some of the negative comments in other reviews:1. Yes, the handle is a bit thin and flimsy, but it is sturdy enough for removing thin ice without worrying about it breaking.2. Yes, the brass blade does attract ice shavings and they do pile up on the scraper, but this does not interfere with removing the ice or make the scraper difficult to use.3. Yes, the blade is only 3\", but because this scraper works more efficiently than a larger plastic scraper blade, you will not spend any longer removing the ice.While this scraper works well for thin ice on your windshield and windows, for thicker ice you do need a heavier duty scraper. This scraper simply cannot effectively \"bite into\" thicker ice.IMPORTANT: Some sellers charge a full shipping charge for each scraper you order no matter how many you order at one time. To avoid this, based on another review I ordered my 4 scrapers through Firehawk Technology, which had an additional shipping charge for each extra scraper of only fifteen cents.Bottom line: This product works very well. Make sure you don't get ripped of with excessive shipping charges."

This is just like the ones I remember--they work better than any other scraper, and brass is softer than glass so they don't scratch. Brass is flexible enough to follow the countoru of the window, thin enough to get underneath ice. Haven't had these long enough to judge durability, but I'm guessing that durability will be similar, and OK but not great. (If used on heavy ice, the brass blade eventually came loose)A few sellers had similar items cheaper, but if buying several they charged full shipping on each scraper. CJ Insustries didn't charge nearly as much per scraper after the first one, and wound up considerably cheaper overall."

I still have that same scraper today, and the blade is still like new after 30+ years of use scraping New England ice from a couple of dozen different windshields. A few years ago a local hardware store started carrying them, and I bought a half dozen to give to family and friends. They've since gone out of business, so I can't get them locally anymore, but I'm glad they're still available online. I'd love to find the manufacturer and buy a couple of cases at wholesale."

A plastic blade, when cold, just cannot bend like a metal blade. The result is that only a small section of the plastic contacts the glass and so only a narrow path is scraped clean. Metal, on the other hand, better conforms to the curvature of the glass and scrapes clean the full width.I myself have doubts about just how much brass is in the \"brass blade\", but whatever metal it is, it works, and I'm satisfied. I bought a box full and distributed them as Christmas presents.One warning: Use this scraper only on glass, for it can easily scratch paint.Made in the USA."

The second 'weakness' is that this will shatter clear ice on your windshield into tiny ice crystals that fly up onto your hand - wear gloves and dust your hands off when you're done with it - they'll have quite a lot of powdered ice on them."

I love them but, the first one I bought was a different style/manufacturer and the blade was very thin. If I looked at it funny, it bent, and then of course, it wouldn't scrape worth a darn. So I bought five, worried that I might get another thin blade. Boy was I wrong, the blade is thick and sturdy, and while the plastic handle is a little flimsy, I don't have any worries about the blade! A half inch of frozen rain on my windshield...not a problem, gone in seconds! I LOVE THIS SCRAPER!! There, I said it, I love it. I now have one in each of my vehicles, I gave one to my next door neighbor, I gave one to my best friend, and I have a spare in my house that we can use on our ceramic top stove if needed. Not only am I happy with my purchase (remember, I bought FIVE, yes FIVE) so is my neighbor and my best friend (and his wife). LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this scraper!"

Basically, if you haven't used this you don't know what you're missing...just like if you use a knife to slice cheese instead of a real cheese slicer, you don't know what you're missing. Sure you CAN slice cheese with a knife just like you CAN scrape ice with a plastic scraper, but it's effortless with a cheese slicer and you get uniform, predictable results--which is what this product gives you: uniform, predictable results. With a typical plastic ice scraper you go back and forth and back and forth, over and over the ice, accomplishing the same thing but with far more effort.The only reason I give it four stars rather than five is because the plastic handle isn't the least bit ergonomic and is too flexible to be held by the end for more reach.

Plastic scrapers are completely inadequate for ice even if you use the side with the sawtooth that breaks up the ice first.In fact, most scrapers suck. It's hard to believe that after a hundred years of cars there wouldn't be better ice scrapers, but we still have crappy plastic ones that easily get nicks in their blades leaving little ice streaks on every stroke. They also tend to slide up and over thicker ice buildup.The Fantastic Ice Scraper is definitely better, and for two bucks it's easy on the wallet. It's the brass blade that does it -doesn't scratch glass and goes through rather thick ice buildup better than any other scraper I've ever had. Brass also bends a little (also why I found credit cards not bad for frost scraping)and this helps it conform to slight curvatures in the windshield.The handle could be longer and textured better for a solid grip but this tyhing is way out above all, so I gave it five stars.BTW, They also are handy for other scraping duties.I bought ten of 'em, keep one in my toolbox and gave a few away to family and friends."

But I've been frustrated for years with every single plastic bladed scraper I've ever bought, until I saw this one for sale. The first thought of course is \"Oh no! The metal blade will scratch the safety glass!\" but this blade is of a softer metal than the glass coating. What's so great about it is that being metal, and thin, it shaves the ice off the windows perfectly, effortlessly, and neatly, almost as if the blade was heated or something. Buy one for every car & truck you own. Of course a bigger longer brush type window cleaner is much better for removing accumulated snow, but just for ice or especially heavy frost, this scraper is PERFECT."

LCD was poor, would flicker because the refresh rate was not right, had one less decimal place to look at, etc. It was a complete disappointment, considering that at Wal-Mart prices, it was $1.50 higher than the Equus here at Amazon. I returned it and was super-glad that I could find this one here on Amazon. I have it in service and it is absolutely great. It works well, works correctly and is accurate. It has two units past the decimal place, not just one (the picture shows 12.6 as the reading but it would actually give you 12.63, as an example).This is the unit to get, you cannot go wrong. My only desire for improvement would be if the color of the LCD could be varied from just green to maybe red as well."

It found issues in two of the five.In one, it showed a weak battery, although there was no indication from the operation of the car or the dash display. The battery was still under warranty, so took it in for testing. The store found one bad cell, and replaced the battery under the terms of the warranty.On another vehicle, the Equus pointed out that the charging system was not putting out as much charge as needed to keep the battery up whith the engine at idle whith AC, lights on, blower, and engine fan running.I have numerous electrical testers, high quality multi-meters, current clamps, etc that I would normally use to test electrical systems. Now, this is the first device I pull out to monitor or test a susspected electrical problem. It may not let you know what is the exact problem, but it will point you in the direction, and in a number of cases (weak/bad batteries), pinpoint the problem such that someone with limited knowledge of automotive electrical systems will be able to fix the problem.Amazon did their normal great job of delivering the product."

And in case you should forget I guess, they even added a little battery icon in the display.However, I seriously question the accuracy of these units (this is the second one).When plugged in (my van has multiple outlets, I check on 4 of them), the unit shows 11.4 Volts and a red light. Wow, never had an issue with my battery nor charging system. Started the car (which it did fine), unit showed 14.8 Volts. Really!I went to the shop and had everything checked. My high-output alternator (120 amps) was working above manufacturer's specs; my 1000 cold cranking amp battery is in excellent condition.I exchange the unit, the replacement showed the same odd numbers. Now, the manual you can download from Equus (wich does not come with the unit) states issues like that there could be dirty battery terminals etc. etc. I had the shop check the voltage on my cigarette lighter which a regular voltmeter and it showed completely different numbers.We even hooked up the car charger which went into float charging (meaning battery is full) within 2 minutes.The only reason to have this monitor would be to, well, monitor your battery.

I got this to review the voltage readings when the older ones run a/c, etc. This little gauge is accurate to .oo and is a great, great tool. I have used it in all cars to check the alternators, a/c drain, light drain, window motor drain, seat motor drain, etc. This is one of the best auto tools I have ever bought. I use it on all the fleet. Pops in and out with no effort. I use it when I drive and watch the variations of drain when stopped at a light with a/c etc. It has changed mny driving habits - witht the older cars I shift to Park now at longer lights, voltage goes up as the rpms rise slightly. I have ID'd the rpm threshold of each car to hit 13+ on the alternator for low speed or stops at lights or in stuck traffic. Thus the a/c works \"better\" as I can see the relationship with the voltage. My blower fan also has a lot to do with the voltage. Saved me a $1,000 compressor job on my '86 chev caprice for at least another 2 years. Remember, older alternators tend to run hot, that is, produce too much voltage; battery killers. This helps avoid that. Best regards."

By using the port under my radio I could monitor the system voltage and watch what it was doing when the warning light came on. This allowed me to both determine that it was not a failure of the alternator to produce power, and also have confidence that nothing bad was about to happen (dead battery from lack of charging).The Equus has a digital display which shows instantaneous system voltage, a bar showing battery condition and three LEDs which give a quick indication of system health. It also has a hinge where the meter joins the socket connector shaft. This allows the unit to be angled to improve readability.This device is great for a situation where you need to know what your voltage is doing right now, with precision to the hundredth of a volt.

In both cases, when measuring the \"state of charge,\" the meter kept telling me that my batteries had only about 12 v of power, and the red light further indicated that the battery was low in charge. Not sure what this meant (my Odyssey is less than 1 mon old and the CRV just got a new battery last Oct), I took the Odyssey to the dealer, and they measured it and told me that my battery was in good working conditions. The Odyssey has a built-in \"low charge\" warning system which never came on so it further suggested that the meter's reading is wrong. Is the meter defective? I assume so so I have returned it. It is also possible that in some cars, the auxiliary power outlets do not output the full 12.6 v so one cannot use this to measure the actual voltage in the battery. Either way, before you buy this, be aware of this issue and talk to your service manager first."

I decided it was time to replace the (stock, six year old) battery as that had to be the cause but wanted to make sure the new battery was charging (alternator was doing its job) and holding enough charge from the 23 mile round trip I do each day.Now I can clearly see that the new battery is charging as I drive (usually around 14.6 volts according to this device) and it also shows that when the car is parked, there is a slight draw but the battery rarely falls below 12.5 volts when sitting.I've left it in all the time (the draw is VERY low)except when I plug in my sat-nav but it has pretty much done its job already. It will be useful to have in the future though, if another car or a friend's car develops problems.For the cost, it is a great little device and was useful to show me that I made the correct decision to replace the old battery, even though the repair shops seemed to think the old battery was still ok."

There could be other causes (such as a dead short), but the battery is easily diagnosed by a battery dealer (usually a free service). My friendly auto shop was reluctant to consider the battery as this is a 6 month old replacement for another battery I bought from them just 18 months prior.PROS:Easy to use: plug it into a cigarette adapter with the engine off, and again with the engine running.Comes with a straight-forward user card for interpreting the LED values.Display head pivots for easy viewing.Good materials and workmanship (at this early stage anyway).Useful for any vehicle with a 12 volt system (I have a cigarette adapter with battery clips, making this monitor useful on a motorcycle or ATV, very handy).Inexpensive diagnostic piece of equipment, easily fits in the glove box and available.Helps to quickly eliminate guesswork.Cons: none"

It's very easy to use and accurate.My issue began when it fell apart in the cigarette lighter socket. The tip, chrome collar, fuse, and nut came apart from the body as I withdrew it from the socket. I shut the car off and used forceps to retrieve the pieces, blowing the fuse in the socket in a shower of sparks in the process.I reassembled the monitor and it did not work. Inside the house, it was apparent the fuse had blown when it came apart in the socket. I emailed the manufacturer to ascertain the value of the fuse as it was not clearly marked.They insist there is no fuse in it. Excerpted from their initial response: \"There is no fuse internal to this part so I'm guessing your are referring to the fuse in the vehicle. I do not have any information on those fuses.\"I offered to send them pictures, asked them again the value of the fuse, reminding them it could be legal problems if a consumer replaced the fuse with an incorrect value.Here is the response I received from the manufacturer:\"There is no legal ramification becuase the tool is clearly designed not to be opened or serviced by the end user. Since it is not intended to be serviced we do not have the information on the replacement fuse.Sorry\"(the misspelling is theirs, the reply was \"cut and paste\" verbatim in it's entirety from their email response)Help me out here. The tip so easily unscrews it falls apart in normal occasional use and falls apart in the cigarette lighter socket? If it were true the fuse was not meant to be replaced by the end user, it seems to me the unit would be glued, welded, or otherwise secured so the end user would not be tempted open it. I would think the manual and product literature would clearly state \"no user serviceable parts inside\".With that being said, I would not hesitate to purchase this again for use. It is easy to use, accurate, and useful. Be aware you should make sure the nut is tight before each use."

                "text" : "The Honda 2005 civic has a marginal charging system. This meter is ideal for determining when it is time to turn off the radio to reduce load on the alternator. Voltage reading is very accurate, much better than 1% as measured against a small Beckman pocket meter, which in turn has been checked against a Powerex Wizard aa cell charger. Warning lights function well.Some things to note when using this tester: Standard voltage of a 12 volt battery is 12.6 volts. Some deep cycle absorbed glass mat batteries will read 12.8. This is after loading the battery by turning on the headlights for 10 seconds, to remove surface charge. Note that while the lights are on, the voltage drops quickly at first, then the voltage stabilizes. Turning off the lights causes the voltage to rise again gradually. After a few minutes the voltage will stop rising. If the voltage settles at 12.6 (or 12.8 for AGM battery) battery is charged, assuming that the battery is near 68 degrees F. Lower temps raise the voltage, higher temps lower the voltage. For a standard battery figure about 12.66 volts at 32 F and 12.54 volts at 104 F battery temperature, not air temperature.After a car has been running for awhile with no lights, radio, wipers, AC, heat or window defroster, the alternator may cycle letting the battery voltage drop for a while before kicking in. This is OK provided the charging is steady shortly after turning on the lights. An intermittant alternator will cause the red light to turn on and off when headlights are on.The bar graph for battery condition is not very useful as the meter has only voltage information.The instructions do not state that this tester is for negative ground cars only, a small quibble as positive ground is not common.Had I bought this device six months ago I could have avoided killing a brand new battery in six months.UPDATE: Still working fine as of Aug 2, 2012"

A green light indicates a correctly functioning electrical system. All is well with both battery and, most importantly, the alternator.The Equus is also an accurate voltmeter. Digital read-outs give exact voltage in the electrical system. Potential alternator problems or a failing battery will be indicated by below normal voltages, plus an amber or red light. Extra information is a battery icon graphically showing total battery charge. Tending towards erratic read-outs, and therefore unreliability, it is not the unit's best feature.Equus's instruction card is easy to understand. The unit is well made, sturdy, easy to connect and to transfer to any 12 volt system not having its own voltmeter. Also, as a supplemental monitor in an RV, or a bigger boat with a remote 12 Volt outlet in a sleeping area far from the main instrument panel, overall battery condition condition can be monitored while camping or at anchor.Good value for money; very useful.

Each of those times, it was the battery that stranded us. Here's the point...a battery monitor may prevent a weak or defective battery from stranding you. I can't imagine one any better than this Equus unit for the price and ease of use. It is well made and gives both a digital and an LED read out. The digital read out is back-lighted making it easy to read. It is inexpensive. I am going to buy a few more to give as Christmas gifts."

I get the same reading on my other car as well.

I have other transportation for work but this is my favorite ride. A tricked up 1984 ford with a rebuilt and improved cross flow Australian 6. I fitted a more powerful alternator a few months back and from the gauge reading on this device I have installed a good alternator. Get one of these if you ever need to know the charge of your battery and the health of the charging system. All the relevant information is there to see for yourself at a glance with this monitor. I'm sure most people will find this very handy. The price is sensational."

I also considered the labor of running wire through my firewall, cost of purchasing a pillar mount and the aesthetics of just slapping another gauge on the dash.Then I found the Equus 3721! A great example of an otherwise unknown product making it big on Amazon. With well over a hundred positive reviews I decided to spend the $15 quickly and I'm happy I did. Totally idiot proof, just take it out of the package and plug it into your 12V accessory outlet. Instantly I could check the charging voltage (while the truck is running) and the battery voltage (when the truck is off). The battery charge \"indicator\" on the right side of the display doesn't seem accurate but for what it is - an inexpensive digital voltage gauge that has no install time - it is a GREAT value."

Of couse, serious trouble shooting must be done with a tester that has probes, etc. But I'm using it mainly to check on the trailer battery & to make sure my solar charger is keeping up, etc.It's easy to read & the swivel head allows you to change the angle for best reading. It came with a bunch of instructions on how to test the battery, etc. but I just wanted a Voltmeter, that's all. This one works fine. I would have preferred an analog type like my old one because these digital meters are always so sensitive that they kind of go nuts at the slightest fluctuation, but it works.

By monitoring these voltages, you can avoid a no-start due to a dead battery.There's a chart on the back of the package that says if you get a battery reading of 12.0 or above before you start your car, your battery is OK. To get this pre-start reading, you may need to first turn the ignition key to the accessory position (i.e. the position that lets you run the radio with the engine off).If, after the car is started, you get a charging reading between 13.0 and 15.0, your alternator is OK.By tracking the trends, you'll have great insight into the health of your car's electrical system. For example, if your battery voltage is trending down over time, your battery is running down. Is it because the battery is failing, or is it because your alternator is not charging it properly? If your alternator readings have been steady and in the normal range, you know the battery is the culprit.My advice is to ignore the 3721's bull-donkey extra features, and focus on digital readout. For example, I just bought a new battery and the when I tested it with the Equus, the red warning light came on. D'oh! However, the digital readout said 12.46, which is fine.There are a couple of other things on the easy-to-read display to ignore besides the dummy lights. I have no clue what they mean (there's no explanation on the package). Just focus on the digital readout and you'll get maximum usefulness out of this unit.Besides the Equus, I suggest you get a portable battery jump starter, which you can find on Amazon for $40 or more. If your battery starts going downhill and you don't have time to replace it, put the charged jump starter in your car. That way, if you come out to a dead battery, you'll be able to start your car without calling AAA or finding someone to give you a jump."

                "text" : "This is a useful device to have in your car but you must understand it's limitations. In many cars, it will not be as accurate as taking a reading directly off your battery, which you can do with this device, if you buy this inexpensive additional adapter:Roadpro 12V Battery Clip-On and Cigarette Lighter AdapterThe reason for this is that in vehicles where you have to turn on the ignition to ACC in order to power the cigarette lighter port, once you do that, the vehicle's electronics are also powered and will draw power. So, you will see a lower reading on this device than if you take a reading directly from the battery with the key out of the ignition. In vehicles where the lighter port is always powered, this device can be more accurately used directly plugged in to that port.However, for taking a reading of your charging circuit with the engine running, this can be used in the lighter port in any vehicle.Note that you can do all of this with any household multimeter however the chances of you having that in the vehicle are slim. Most all multimeters also require a battery in them so even if you store one of those in your vehicle, the chances are high that when you need to use it, the internal battery will be dead.This Equus unit however requires no internal battery (at least I don't think it has one), so you can just throw it in your glovebox indefinitely.Car batteries typically last around 5 years so after about 3.5 years is when you may want to periodically use this device to check the health of your battery. Basically, anything under 12v after the vehicle has been sitting for at least 4 hours is a sign the battery should likely be replaced. Above 12v and the battery is probably fine as long as the vehicle starts up.When a friend or relative asks me to check their battery, the first question I ask them is \"Does your cigarette lighter port work all the time, or just when you put the key in the ignition and turn on the car?\". If they say it's always on, I know I can pretty adequately test their battery just through the lighter port. If however they say it only turns on when they put their car to ACC, I know I will have to have them open their hood so I can read the battery directly with the Equus.The other good thing about this is that you could leave it plugged in all the time for a constant monitoring of your electrical system voltage while driving and parked.For the price, this device is nice to have if you understand how to use it.If you want a more robust battery tester that can not only give you the voltage, but also the CCA rating (cold cranking amps), I recommend this:SOLAR BA7 100-1200 CCA Electronic Battery and System Tester"

                "text" : "I was skeptical that something this inexpensive could be so useful. But once you plug this tester into your cigarette lighter, you'll see this this little device is a lot more intelligent than you might think.With the car not running, the tester shows your battery voltage and status. A little battery icon tells you that the tester knows the car is not running, and that the LCD is displaying Battery Status. You can see the exact voltage on the LCD screen. Novices can simply look at the red, yellow, or green LEDs to quickly determine the health of your battery. To put your mind at ease, a little bar graph shows you the relative battery voltage.Once you start the car, the little battery icon goes out and you see a little charging circle icon displayed - this tells you the device knows the car is running and that it is now displaying Charging Status. After you let the engine warm up, hold the engine at about 2500 RPM. The neat little LCD display now shows you the alternator's charging voltage. A green LED will satisfy you that the charging system is healthy, a yellow will caution you that your charging system might need some maintenance, and finally the red LED alerts you that your battery is being either under- or over-charged. The LCD display and graph indicates the exact nature of any problems.IT'S VERY IMPORTANT to note that your cigarette lighter socket must be COMPLETELY CLEAN for this tester to be happy and useful. Clean out the socket good with a plastic (NON-METALLIC!) brush, then blow any debris with a quick blast from a can of compressed air (blowing from your mouth is NOT enough). Proper operation of this tester will display the LCD voltage being stable, or moving either consistently up OR consistently down. If the voltage fluctuates erratically, or if the devices turns itself on and off, clean the cigarette lighter socket, then re-seat the tester firmly in the socket. If the device still behaves erratically, that's a sign that your battery terminals may be loose.Most garages will charge you $20 a pop for what this wonderful tester does for a few bucks in three minutes. Someone with advanced knowledge of cars can have way too much fun with this tester."

                "text" : "This monitor replaces my old one which I gave away at our yacht club. Couldn't find another one at Walmart so got them here. This newer version displays voltage to two decimal places, which is useful on my 38' Sabre cruiser since I use it to tell what the relative electrical draw is when I turn on a particular light or device. I have an analog voltmeter on my electric panel, but this is far more useful. I also finally realized that this monitor does in fact have some mysterious circuitry which lets it judge the level of charge in the battery banks not only in the 10-12 volt range, when the engine and its alternator are off, but it can do this even while charging, when the voltage is running in the 13-14v range. Apparently its program detects whether or not the system is charging and judges the level of charge accordingly. And it does all this by just sampling the voltage in the boat \"cigarette lighter\".Its especially cheering that this automotive item works just fine for my boat since \"Marine\" equipment can be pricey. I bought three, one for the chart/electical area, one for my sleeping cabin and one for the cockpit so I can check battery use/ condition under sail when power can still be drawn down (GPS, Radar, radio),or in the evening when others may be using power (pumps, electic toilet, etc.) Drawing voltage down too far is bad for batteries and the worst case, not being able to start the engine, can be a disaster."

                "text" : "I looked at several gadgets of this type, and settled on the Equus because it had the features I wanted and better reviews than other similar devices. I have a 1991 Nissan 300ZX Twin Turbo, and these cars are notorious for having alternator failures. The car has a full set of gauges, but there is no voltage/amperage dial and I wanted to be able to monitor the battery voltage and charging status whenever the car is being driven without running a bunch of new wiring to an added gauge. The 3721 does the job, is well built, and fits in with the other items on the center console perfectly. I'm grateful to report that the charging circuit on my 200,000+ mile Z appears to be working flawlessly, but it is good to be able to keep an eye on it. The only problem I encountered is that I bought two of these items and couldn't get the other one to fit in the lighter socket on my Pathfinder without covering up other things I need to see - the Equus is just a bit bulky, so you have to find a spot where you have a lighter/12 volt power socket and the room for the device. I really like the way the display can be swiveled for different mounting situations and I also like the way it displays voltage, charge status, and has an LED that shows the electrical status at a glance as well. I highly recommend this product! I also highly recommend the 300ZX Twin Turbo, but that is a different review for a different day..."

Other sizes/colors were available in the store too.What I really like about this chamois is that it is made of synthetic fiber and works even better than deerskin. Years ago I used a natural deerskin chamois and found it gross to touch especially when it was wet; it smelled funky and felt really slimy. Plus the thought of wringing water from a deer's skin was creepy.I've used the Absorber for about 6 car washes and it has held up to almost as many times in the washing machine. It soaks up (and holds) a lot of water. I only have to wring it out about four times to dry the entire car. Another bonus is that you can store it damp in the container and don't have to leave a stiff and scratchy deer pelt hanging in the garage. I would definitely recommend the Absorber."

The main issue with hide chamois is they just don't hold much water, this one does and makes drying a snap.I liked this so much a bought a few more and my wife and I use them as towels for use at the pool & water park. For this purpose there is no equal. Just stick it in a pocket or hanging out of the waist band and when your done with a ride ring it out and dry yourself off! Wash it once home with a small amount of bleach (do not dry it) and put it back in its container to keep it moist.Overall this is simply the best chamois you can get and there's a million uses for it!"

I purchased one at a Pep Boys last year, and one at Wal-Mart a few weeks ago.Product: 5 Stars.It is a synthetic chamois that has a vaguely rubbery feel.It can be wrung out after getting wet and used to sop up more moisture.Uses Below...Price: 4 Stars.If there is a harbor freight near you, they also sell a Chinese knock-off version of this for about $5, less than half the price of both brands for almost the same thing. The material is a little softer since it is not as dense, and you can see the fibers woven through it that are used for structural integrity. The 'real' one may not have these, i haven't held mine up to the light to check. Most people will be just fine with the HF one.This is:Perfect pool-side towel, car chamois, camp towel, motorcycle, etc.Good for cleaning up spills and wetness. Hard floors: soak and wring. Carpet: Soak the spill in water (Yes, make it WORSE), THEN put towel over and apply pressure to soak up.Mores uses I'm sure, but this are the ones I find I use the most.Every home should have one of these.Stories:Pool - My 5 cousins and I use a single one of these when drying off after using the pool, but any number of people can as long as they're not germophobes. Dry, wring, repeat.Car - Don't want water spots? Wash and rinse car as per usual, use this to dry it off. If you're paranoid of it picking up particulate like a sponge can, machine wash it first.Motorcycle - Use it to dry after washing. Dry seat after a rain so you don't soak up wetness with your pants. Friend uses a thick foam seat pad, after riding in the rain and then washing it, was soaked through. He didn't want to put his rain gear on so we put the towel on top of it and stepped on it to pull the moisture out, it was nearly dry after a few wrings."

Great for drying cars, motorcycles, whatever. If you wanted to dry your own body with it, you could, but then you should wash it regularly. It does need to be moist to work, so just wring it out and store it. Once moist, it stays moist almost indefinitely if kept in it's container, even though there is a drain hole. The only caveat is that some kinda black mold does grow on it, or in it."

It squeezes out easy and stores quite well in the container it comes in. I have used it a number of times and am generally happy with it.I should mention it is does not perfectly get every last bit of water. But it dries to the point where the residual water evaporates in a minute or so. I consider that pretty good and my goal of not having water spots is met so I'm a happy camper.

The finish on my car is pristine and my 7 year old Chevrolet may be getting old, but the paint/finish sparkles just as is it did on the day I picked it up from the lot. I even use the cloth for a few days after I washed my car to get rid of any morning dew to prevent water streaks.One good suggestion is that after you're done drying, spray THE ABSORBER with the hose and ring it out to ensure all heavy debris is removed from the product. I always roll it up neatly in the form that I purchased it in and always store it in the container. It will feel slightly moist every time you take it out, but that lets me know that it's still working.From the looks of these reviews people suggest putting it in the washer/dishwasher to clean but honestly I have yet to try this out in the last 10 years (oops?) but it still seems perfectly clean.Buy at least one of these or 2+ if you want to keep it in handy places."

For this purpose there is no equal. Just stick it in a pocket or hanging out of the waist band and when your done with a ride ring it out and dry yourself off! Wash it once home with a small amount of bleach (do not dry it) and put it back in its container to keep it moist.Overall this is simply the best chamois you can get and there's a million uses for it!"

Practical though, because you don't have to waste a bunch of regular towels - just squeeze it and reuse. Has the texture of a thin piece of leather. Doesn't scratch the paint, unless you get some dirt caught in it. And if you clean the car thoroughly first, that won't happen. It does need to be put away damp though. If you don't it'll dry out very stiff. It claims not to grow mold/mildew, even when stored wet, though I haven't tested that out long-term. Short-term (two weeks) it seemed fine.Disadvantages:* It tends to not absorb all the water, even when you start. It'll leave small thin streaks on the car which you have to pass over again.* There's a relatively high amount of friction in the material, so it's hard to move it across the car. After a few minutes of use it improves a bit.* Dirt stains refuse to come out easily - wouldn't recommend it for washing the car.If I had opportunity to buy again, at the right price, I would.

Now back to my blurb.-----After watching the silly \"ShamWow\" infomercial once or twice I developed the desire to purchase a chamois like product. My first attempt was with the previously mentioned \"--Wow\" which really left a lot to be desired. Quite frankly, it was crap! Once I was burned by the hype, I figured I'd try a different approach, I'd do some research. (novel idea) Upon hitting up Amazon I found that this one always got high reviews and people seemed to be saying, \"yep, it's the one!\". So I bought it and I haven't been disappointed. It works like a chamois, period. Get it a little damp, use it to suck up liquids, squeeze, repeat. It gets the job done.If you want something that acts exactly like a REAL lambskin chamois that's not a REAL lambskin chamois, this is the product for you. Just buy it and be happy."

                "text" : "My wife was extremely pleased to find that this item is Made in Japan--both because she takes it as a sign of quality and because she's Made in Japan herself.We're also familiar with this kind of product in Japan, where it's called a \"gum towel.\"I bought two actually, one for her and one for me to use on my bicycles--thinking it would be something like a super absorbant chamois rather than a gum towel. It's certainly super absorbant, but doesn't have the chamois quality I would need to, say, polish my bike frames. That is to say it's more sticky than soft, more like a piece of foam rubber or neoprene than a cloth.So if I just hosed down the bike while cleaning and wanted to get on with the next steps of polishing and relubing, this towel is a great way to dry the bike when it's neither hot nor dry enough of a day for the bike to dry out on it's own in a fair amount of time.It really draws the water out too, from every knook and cranny, so no need to use DW-40 before lubing my nice clean parts.My wife uses ours for everything from picking up spills to quickly drying wet clothing that can't go in the dryer. If you wash a sweater for example, it's best to roll it up in the Absorber before laying it out to dry, as this will cut your drying time to at least half and make it less of a hazard that the sweater will get out of shape.We use my far more grungy one as you might use a wet vac. It actually does a better job than a wet vac though.Add that I've used several gum towels in Japan, mostly for swimming, and this is by far the thickest one I've used--therefore more absorbant. And at 27\" x 17\" it's big enough to be used as a bath towel without having to ring it out over and over again.BOTTOM LINE:I recommend this particular make and model over others simply based on the large size and the thickness of the towel.Don't expect to use this to polish or dust, as the texture of the towel is far too sticky for that.I initially searched for the Sham-Wow on Amazon because I had seen it on TV, and still would like to try it out because it seems like it might be more chamois like--where you could wipe and polish with it.Overall, we're thrilled with the quality, size, and how well this item works. Absolutely 5 stars."

This thing is amazing at what it does and leaves my car streak-free and shining beautifully when done.

After you done, just put back in the container or just leave it dry. Yes, it will become like cardboad stiff but just add water and it is ready for business! Why spend so much money on paper towel and drying towel to dry your car? One of these Absorber will do the trick! AND! It costs 50% less than any retail store in Canada... Amazon shipped and arrived in a week. PERFECT."

I also own a black car, which is why I am so picky. NO SWIRL MARKS TO THIS DAY!POSITIVES:-Great towel, dries in 1-2 swipes completely. No water drops or bubbles left.-Comes with nice storage case, and makes it compact to carry around!-No swirl marks! There is no rigged textiles on this towel, and its very soft. Feels like a piece of leather.-1 Towel for the entire car. Hold water like a beast! Doesn't dry anymore? Wringe it out and continue on! No need to have 2 or 3 towels!NEGATIVES:-I have heard horror stories if you drop this towel on the ground, but that is the same as with any towel. Keep this towel clean and it will last.-Can generate a funky smell over time, but just make sure to rinse out all the water and its fine.-USE THIS TOWEL ON THE BODY ONLY! Please don't use this towel to dry off tires and rims because it will dirty it beyond belief and only reduce the quality of the product.OVERALL:If you are looking for an amazing towel, this is it. Take care of this towel and it will bring you happiness, drop it and step on it you will be sadly disappointed. Take care of this towel like your car, and it will make both of you happy! I promise. (I have used this towel for over 12 washes!)"

I regularly wash my SUV (Black 2006 4runner) and to dry I have used all different type of towels, and drying methods, but all have failed and leave nasty streaks all over my vehicle. However, this product is amazing! I mean, really, it is! It soaks up so much water and completely dries the vehicle in no time and it leaves behind NOOOOOOO STREAKS!!!!! I was so shocked. Not only that, the reviews say the towel lasts for years! and all you have to do is keep it in the holder moist. If it gets dirty, throw it in the washing machine! This is one tough towel and it does what it says. This is nothing like a Sham Wow or other gimmicky towel. This is the real deal! I will be purchasing more for family and friends!5/5 stars!"

I have always just rolled it up after I use it and keep it in the provided tube. Even when it goes several weeks between uses, the Absorber is still slightly damp and ready to use. This is extremely important, as anyone that has ever tried to use a dried out chamois knows... I had thought that keeping it in the tube would maybe make it smell or get mildew or something like that. Not the case at all.I sometimes use the absorber for greasy cleaning, on those occassions, I will wash it in the washer. It comes out perfectly fine. I don't put it in the dryer as there is no need.For the use on the boat, I highly recommend this product. After washing boat, a quick wipe with the absorber keeps all the water sports off of the chrome and aluminum. It also keeps water spots off any waxed areas. Sometimes, we go fishing very early in the morning and the seats are wet with condensation - the Absorber is perfect for a quick solution.I have also rolled ice cubes up into the absorber and put it around my neck on a few extremely hot days of fishing the Gulf. It's not perfect for that, but still helped a lot!I can't imagine anyone not giving this product a perfect rating."

If you wring it out (edges too) it doesn't streak, leave water behind, and works about as well as a natural chamois. It will also last for years if left damp and stored in the plastic container, (nope don't dry it). Then why use a natural chamois? Well for me there is something about the shine left behind with a natural chamois. I'm 69 years old and have used those since a teenager. Now that maybe just a memory lane thing since this works just fine. If you don't want to dry, and as I do stretch and soften a natural chamois after use, then get this. It works very well, plus I have never found anything synthetic, that works as well. (Believe me I've tried a lot different ones too. Haaa) I do recommend it. Hope this helps someone."

I am expecting this to last for a few more years as long as I take care of it. It definitely out performs a natural skin chamois. I have not used any of my chamois since I starting using the Absorber and at about 1/3 the cost, it is a real deal. Also, the product is much easier to ring dry."

This thing absorbs so much water you won't believe it till you use it, and it just takes a beating and keeps on going. When I first used it I was afraid I was gonna rip it by twisting the water out too hard, nope, just keep wringing it out until its dry and continue on.A little secret to using it, at least I've found it to work better this way. When drying the car, lay the Absorber out flat (unfold it across the surface) and then grasp it at one end at each corner and drag it slowly across the car allowing it to absorb all the water it comes into contact with. This works especially well on horizontal surfaces, but still good enough on the vertical ones as well. This practice also helps to prevent scratching of the surface when small particles get trapped between the chamois and the paint surface and then your hand comes and pushes it right into the paint.Little warning, when it comes, don't smell it. Mine reeeeekkkkkeeedddd! But I just rinsed it out and the smell went away. Yes it is true that you can put it right back into the tube wet (Well to get it back in the tube, you must, because you can't roll it once it dry), but I like to leave the top off of the tube to allow air in there to dry it out before I close it up and that musty gross smell comes back.Long story short: Get it, you won't be disappointed."

So you end up with a pile of wet towels to wash and a dog that is still rather wet.Enter The Absorber. It absorbs a TON of water and when it's soaked through, you wring it out and it's ready for more, not just a little more, a lot more. My dog comes away from a drying with this towel only a bit damp, which is an enormous improvement over every other towel we've tried, where he stays wet for hours and continues to shake himself off periodically.

I walked around the car expecting to have to do some finishing up but it was all done. Let the sheep keep their skins. Get an Absorber.I don't know if Amazon will want this in the review but I think the material is very interesting. I went to check out what it is made of, (Polyvinyl Alcohol), and I found the following:\"Polyvinyl alcohol has excellent film forming, emulsifying, and adhesive properties. It is also resistant to oil, grease and solvent. It is odorless and nontoxic. It has high tensile strength and flexibility, as well as high oxygen and aroma barrier properties. However these properties are dependent on humidity, in other words, with higher humidity more water is absorbed. The water, which acts as a plasticiser, will then reduce its tensile strength, but increase its elongation and tear strength. PVA is fully degradable and is a quick dissolver. PVA has a melting point of 230C and 180-190C for the fully hydrolysed and partially hydrolysed grades. It decomposes rapidly above 200C as it can undergo pyrolysis at high temperatures.\" via WikipediaI thought the part about it being fully degradable was cool because I was thinking as I used it that it was kind of indestructible and would last forever.It works as well as I could have expected. It's a good deal for $10. I haven't used a Shamwow so I can't make that comparison."

There are a lot of PVA drying towels out there that are cheaper, but believe me, this one is superior in thickness and quality. I bought a cheap, generic one at Wal-Mart and it started tearing apart within a couple days.I use mine to wipe down just about anything and everything you'd use a normal towel for. It won't get something as immediately dry to the touch as a towel since it is slightly damp to start with, but evaporation quickly takes care of the rest. The main advantage over a towel is that it works like both a towel and a sponge, depending on how wet it is. It's nice and cool to the touch so it doubles as a cooling cloth in the summer heat. When it gets too wet, you just wring it out. When it gets a little dirty, soak it in a little soap and water and wring it out or throw it in the washer (just make sure you don't put it in the dryer, it comes out of the washer slightly damp, just like it should be stored). Every few washes, I recommend using some bleach in the wash or soaking it with some bleach to help keep it like new."

I cut the strip into two for the times that I might have help to dry the cars. This works excellent for drying cars, even the windows. Holds a fair amount of water so you don't have to constantly wring it. I know the instructions say store it in the tube, but I let it dry out over a bucket. When I need to use it, I just soak it in water and wring it out. I probably wash on average 3 cars (including 2 SUVs) a week, except rainy weather (I live in SoCal). I rebought this product again in the fall of 2012 because I love it so much. But I haven't opened the new one just yet. Maybe I'll open it in the spring of 2013. I definitely got my money's worth out of this."

(not even close to shoe polish though)Application:Use a non-abrasive cleaner to clean leather of dirt and previous oils. Make sure to give application time to soak in. You can also use on synthetic leather, but don't expect for it to adsorb as much (almost pointless, but works about 20% as well). Give it plenty of time to dry, the longer the better. Also would advise to put into the sun to dry quicker. Wipe down, repeat as many times as you wish."

Granted, upon application it feels sticky and a little greasy, and 15 minutes of sitting doesn't resolve this so you can wipe down lightly with a dry cloth if you think it will help. However, I found for best results, apply the conditioner then let it sit on the leather for about a day (two if you can help it) and don't wipe down. I know this doesn't sound practical for most people but I do think it gives the best results for good feel and well conditioned leather.Use this after cleaning with Lexol leather cleaner or just on it's own if you think your leather is clean enough.

It has accumulated many oil, food, and miscellaneous discolorations on the contact areas (headrest, armrest, and seats), as well as some very fine dry cracks in the leather due to lack of conditioning for at least the past 5 years. I've used Mcguire's car leather care products in the past with good success in my vehicle, so I figure it should be good for the couch too. So I spent an afternoon cleaning the leather and conditioning it. However it only removed about 50% of the stains and no noticeable difference in the cracks, even after weekly conditioner applications for a month. That's when I bought this Lexol cleaner to give it a try since it has such high reviews. Holy bleep! I was able to buff out ALL of the oils, marks, and stains with just one application and a lot of elbow grease. I was really impressed. So of course, I followed up by using Lexol's conditioner. After about 5 applications spaced over a month. All the fine cracks were \"healed\" and the couch looks new (except until you sit on it and just sink from having been sat on for so many years). Overall, I'm really impressed with Lexol and it will be my go to products for all my leather needs."

It smells great too and if you apply only a thin coating, it is not sticky at all.I have tried other stuff, like Meguiar's, mothers, etc... they don't come close to it's ability to maintain leather like Lexol does. In my old BMW 330i, where I was using Meguiar's leather conditioner, that leather seat was showing the signs of aging, cracking lines appearing throughout the seating surface. The Meguiar's stuff was also very sticky, which implies that very little gets absorbed.Lexol on the other hand, you hardly see a trace of it after 10 mins following applying the coating. The leather is noticeably more supple.The small bottle 8oz for $6 typically last me about 1 year of usage. Key is not to apply too much in each application; apply just enough that the leather will be sufficiently saturated and infused with the leather conditioning emulsion. If you happen to apply too much, and you can tell by how wet it looks, simply take a dry microfiber cloth and wipe off the extra."

I had been using Black Magic's Leather Conditioner/Cleaner combo and some other OTC products without much success. The Lexol pH cleaner worked well to clean the leather, and the conditioner was just amazing. It turned the leather almost brand new and all of the creases were soft again. I recommend using a terry cloth or cotton cloth to apply it onto surfaces. The Lexol conditioner is an amber liquid that is only slightly more viscous than water and has a unique smell.Pros: Very easy to use, and works as advertised. It should be the only leather conditioner you use - the over the counter stuff doesn't work.Cons: Hard to find and expensive, but Amazon carries them at a low price.Overall: If you own any leather accessories or cars with interior leathers, Lexol pH cleaner and Lexol conditions are must-buy items."

I was not successful following the bottle's directions, however. The product did not penetrate the leather evenly, until I decided to apply it as though I were massaging lotion into my own skin. Then, it worked great. I poured some Lexol creme into my cupped hands and massaged it into the leather. Immediately, the sun bleaching began to disappear. I wiped off the excess and allowed the sofa to completely dry. The leather on the sofa looks as good as the day the sofa was delivered. In six months I'll reapply Lexol as a preventative to it sun bleaching/distressing again. This is a wonderful product!"

I put the product on the leather, wait a few minutes for it to get absorbed a bit, and then use a micro fiber towel to clean off. The Lexol leather conditioner did a fine job in cleaning and softening the leather.The price on the conditioner in the last twelve month ranged from $11.24 to $7.99, so the price as I write this review is very good. Note on price research: I found a very helpful tool that shows me the history of Amazon prices, you can find it by searching from Amazon price history and pick the one with the camel in the name. I find it very helpful.A quick note on the spray vs cream packaging. In the past I have used leather conditioning creams, so I bought the spray to compare how it would work. I have to say that overall I like the conditioning cream better because I have more control over where the product is applied. This especially the case when I work inside of the home on my leather chair. When I get to the edges I have to be careful not to over spray."

We didn't want anything greasy or strongly scented, and we definitely didn't want anything that would change the color of our dark brown leather sectional sofa. This product is a milky liquid with a very mild, pleasant scent. It went on evenly and subtly conditioned the sofa without affecting the color at all. If you're looking for a drastic change in your leather, this might not be the right choice. It makes leather a little softer, shinier and newer-looking without leaving it stinky, oily or darker. We could sit on our sofa the same day without any greasy residue on our clothing."

Between the Lexol cleaner and this conditioner, the 10 year old car's leather already looked newer. It can't save the glazing the driver's seat acquired from use, but all the other seats did manage to look like that brand new leather look; slightly matte, firm, but supple.For the price, I think Lexol conditioner's great.

I buffed the shoes again with a clean cloth, but was unable to restore the shine. The leather might be well conditioned, but it sure doesn't look any better.

My car is 7 years old now and the leather looks like new."

Over time, the high quality leather became more distressed than I would like - and started to really look worn. However, the sofa itself was still in great shape. After reading the reviews I ordered a bottle of this - frankly if it didn't work the sofa was probably going to have to be relegated to the basement or replaced. I applied to a small area - and was happy with the results - so started doing the whole thing. I took the advice of another reviewer and actually poured the liquid into my hands and just rubbed it in - worked much better than applying with sponge or cloth. The seats of the sofa took 2 applications, the back and sides only one. My husband said the sofa looked practically brand new. Within hours of a very generous application, the sofa was not sticky and was safe to sit on. This sofa was a soft, (not shiny) leather, and the result was just great. I'll keep this on hand and apply every few months to keep the sofa looking great. I'll try it on our car seats next!"

You can feel the waxy film on your fingers after applying it, which you don't notice with other conditioners, and shows it has somethign substantial in it.All my vehicles have had leather seats and after a few years they have all had dry, cracked creases. I have just got a \"new\" used minivan with leather seats and I want to ensure they don't go the same way. I have to admit I've neglected seats compared with the rest of the vehicle.I used this product on my 1998 pickup's tan-colored front seats which are creased and starting to crack in places. They were pretty dirty and the only way I found to get the grime out was using a Magic Eraser and leather cleaning solution. This is a pretty harsh technique, but effective, apart from in the deepest creases. It did seem to take the shine off the leather, which was a worry. Using the Lexol conditioner, letting it soak in for 15 mins and then buffing with a microfiber cloth, the sheen is back and the leather feels much more supple. It will never return to its \"new\" state, but it should last a few more years with regular applications (not sure but maybe every 3-4 months?). It takes some effort to get through the stickiness at the first buffing, but the surface quickly eases up and a nice sheen (not a false shine) appears.On my minivan, the leather came up like it was just new. It smells good too!I bought this product at my local Advance Auto (sorry Amazon!) and would certainly suggest you pay the extra $3-4 over the other conditioners as it really seems to be properly designed to replace the oils in the leather, not just put a protectant shine on the surface. I'm always sceptical about product claims (since they usually exaggerate performance), but this one seems to be the real deal.Try it.UPDATE (Dec 3 2009):The stiff leather has certainly become more supple after applying this product - it works really well!"

When I opened one of the pockets however I found the true color of the jacket to be exactly what Lexol was returing it to. This product delivers and delivers well, the jacket is now the same uniform color again and it feels much more supple than it used to. It doesn't have the worn funky look it used to, but that look is pretty detrimental to a jacket that is potentially worth hundreds or maybe even over a thousand.Do yourself a favor though, don't apply the product to the leather as they say to do, put it onto a rag and rub it in. This product is labor intensive to use, especially on old worn leather, but the results are truly spectacular. Absolutely recommended and will buy again if I ever happen to run out of this, I didn't seem to dent the bottle too much and further applications will proabaly take much less, looks like this will last a good long while"

Some of the newer leather jackets, that are treated to resist water and stains, will be the hardest to recondition too....at least until they are well broken in.My old deer skin jacket soaked the conditioner up completely after 2 sprayed on applications and is now as supple as a baby's behind. In other words, a well broken in leather will accept the conditioner very well!My newer riding jackets were not in need of a treatment. But I gave it a try on the newest for the fun of it.....and wouldn't you know it, the conditioner wouldn't soak in. It did however give the jacket a fresh look after I wiped off the residue.This stuff is great, does the job well and lasts quit a long time. Been using it over the last 10 years with great results. I've found that applying to the leather with a spray bottle works best for well broken in leather. Newer leather, just a rag to wipe down the leather."

My car seats definitely need Lexol Cleaner, orange bottle, first. They are darker from rubbed on grime over months of body pressure.Cleaning brightens colors AND ADDS MOISTURE. By cleaning first you remove old oils mixed with dirt when that is removed the conditioner penetrates deeper and faster. Cleaner does not work like normal soap or deterent it cleans and restores and primes leather for conditioner. Just give it a try.Its a hassle and extra work but the result is obviously better. It might even be possible to use cleaner without conditoner the cleaner moisturizes too but conditioner seams to seal the surface after it dries unlike the cleaner. You will be surprised how much dirt is on the cloth after cleaning. I change cloths positions to use new clean areas as dirt is removed.

Each loveseat has an arm, one left and the other right. Putting them together makes it one giant piece. It's a lot of leather and that's why I bought this large container.I found that I had to buff a LOT more than I expected. It took days for the conditioner to completely sink in after application, but I applied a heck of a lot thinking I was saving time. You should be aware that buffing will probably be required and it will take some time for the leather to absorb the conditioner.The result is remarkable. The color of the leather seems more vibrant and it has a shine. Ultimately, this is protective of the leather and will make it last a lot longer. In the meantime, it makes the leather look richer.One thing you will have a lot of trouble figuring out based on looking at product information for a large piece of leather furniture is what type of product should be used on it. If you have an expensive piece, most likely there won't be instructions for this. That's because the manufacturer doesn't want to take chances by informing you which conditioner you may use. The retail representatives that I questioned didn't know anything about treating leather.Lexol works just fine on an expensive leather couch as my experience showed."

This product is very runny and seems to be best applied with a sponge or rag. Anything left over can be wiped off after.

It was much thicker than I had hoped, and while that isn't necessarily a bad thing, the end result was that I spent as much time rubbing it in as I would have a paste. Being liquid, my applicator cloth absorbed more than it does when applying a paste, too. In other words, more waste.The other annoyance surfaced after it dried. A lot of white residue shows in the surface texture (\"cracks\") of the leather. Not the look I usually like on something I'm wearing.In summary, the cons are:* Not a true \"spray-on\" conditioner, but rather thick-liquid-in-a-spray-bottle* Excessive waste (vs. paste conditioners)* No time savings (vs. paste conditioners)* Very visible residue after dryingStill looking for the pros."

Specifically, the jacket was particularly rough around the edges and sleeves after a dozen years of wear and tear, applying the Lexol in the manner instructed -- coat area, follow up with damp cloth, wait, buff -- really improved the jacket. The exterior looks great, now just need to get the lining replaced to match the exterior. It smells good too -- not overpowering."
