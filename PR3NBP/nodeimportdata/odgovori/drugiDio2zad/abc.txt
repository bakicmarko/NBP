    summary: 'Transmission cooling fittings not correct',
    text: `Nice radiator. Fit well, however the transmission cooling lines on my 98 C1500 w/ 
a 5.7L are 3/8" however the fittings on the radiator are 5/16". I had to buy two 3/8" to 5/16" inverted flare transmission adapters. Bought them at O'Reilleys for $6.51. Amazon web site 
confirmed this was a fit for my truck. Not a huge deal, but it delayed my repair and added some cost.`
